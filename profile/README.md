**Calista ML Labs** is a personal machine learning and applied AI laboratory by **[Calista Salsabila](https://github.com/calistasalsabila)**.

This organization is dedicated exclusively to **machine learning–focused work**, including:

* Classical machine learning (classification, regression, clustering)
* Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis
* Model evaluation, experimentation, and iteration
* Applied ML projects and small-scale research implementations
* Learning-oriented implementations of ML concepts

> Web-focused development, UI engineering, and system design projects are maintained at **[Calista Web Labs](https://github.com/calista-web-labs)**.
>
> Cross-domain experiments (ML × Web), general coding labs, and programming language explorations are maintained at **[calista-labs](https://github.com/calista-labs)**.

## Purpose

This lab exists as a focused space for **machine learning exploration and growth**:

* understanding ML fundamentals through hands-on projects
* experimenting with models, datasets, and evaluation strategies
* translating theoretical concepts into working implementations

Projects here may include notebooks, experiments, prototypes, and iterative builds.

## Ownership

All repositories in this organization are **personally developed and maintained by [Calista Salsabila](https://github.com/calistasalsabila)**.

## Notes

Some repositories are experimental or works in progress by design. Each repository README describes its scope, goals, and current status.
